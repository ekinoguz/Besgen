## You should be interested if:

* You don't like password manager tools, that save all your passwords somewhere.
* You use different passwords in every website.
* You keep forgetting and resetting your passwords all the time.

## What is Besgen?

Besgen is an extremely simple password generation and retrieval website. It consists of 3 text fields, which are used to generate a random password using HMAC-SHA256. You can input whatever you want to each field, and Besgen will create the same password for you as long as you input the same text, in same order. If your browser allows, it will save the password to your clipboard automatically. Otherwise, your password will be visible on screen for 5 seconds.
